# leaflet-quickstart

A container for quickstarting [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com) projects for
learners, `leaflet-quickstart` provides a single webpage, `index.html`, that
is a full-page map that can be controlled via the JavaScript file
`scripts.js`. 

The webpage loads the following extensions and makes them available to
`scripts.js`:

* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) for styling popups and the cards that
float above the map in the `#above-map` container.
* [Full jQuery](http://jquery.com) to prove access to the `$.getJSON()`
method, should the learner want to download GeoJSON data from somewhere else.
* [Turf.js](http://turfjs.org), an advanced geospatial analysis tool for
analyzing data inside the browser.
* [Leaflet-Providers](https://github.com/leaflet-extras/leaflet-providers),
which provides quick, configurable basemaps for Leaflet
* [Markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it), a Markdown
parser.

This template was written in preparation for teaching a workshop at the NYU
PSL Spatial Humanities Partnership workshop in 2018, [“Exploring the
Geographic Information of Literature and Art History” / “Cartographie
numérique en littérature et en histoire de
l’art”](https://wp.nyu.edu/nyupslgeo/workshop/), but it also builds on the
techniques demonstrated in the later chapters of [_The JavaScripting English
Major_](https://the-javascripting-english-major.org/). In other words, it is
written for humanities and social sciences students eager to learn how to make
web maps.
